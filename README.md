# Rabbit-Year-Assessment

### ~ Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz üìù

## Description

This project allowed me to learn a lot about how to use jaascript to dynamically modify the DOM elements, how we can use timers and how we can use local storage to allow the user to keep their data without using a database! Great challenge :)

## Usage

After cloning and running the project you will be able to test your 2023 year's luck!

This is how the luck is tested: You have 75 seconds to answer all the questions - as fast as you can, for each wrong question 15 seconds will be substracted from your time. 
The game ends when you finish answering the questions or the time remaining is equals zero. Try getting the highest time remaining!
